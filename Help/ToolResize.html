        Resize Images Wizard</h1>
    <p>
        Batch process allows multiple images to be resized; allowing an image to be made larger or smaller by changing the number of
			pixels it contains. An image with less pixels fill take up less space when
			saved but will not be as detailed.</P>
		<P>ImageWalker allows three main ways or types of resizing an image.</P>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<STRONG>Pixel based</STRONG>
			dimensions are entered as a number of pixels directly.
			<li>
				<STRONG>Inch based</STRONG>
			dimensions are entered in inches and a new pixel size is generated based on
			image resolution (pixels per inch)
			<li>
				<STRONG>Centimetres based</STRONG> dimensions are entered in centimetres and a
				new pixel size is generated based on image resolution (pixels per centimetres)</li>
		</ol>
		<P>It is also possible to set a <b>filter </b>that will be used to resize the
			image. This filter defines how the pixels in the image will be sampled during
			the resize. Selecting <b>Automatic Adaptive </b>will normally give the best
			results however experimenting with the filters setting is recommended as
			different images may respond better to a specific filter.</P>
