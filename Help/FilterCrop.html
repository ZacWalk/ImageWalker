    <h1>
        Crop</h1>
    <p>
        Cropping an image is like cropping a photograph: you cut off one or more of the
        image edges, eliminating unwanted parts of the original graphic.</p>
    <h2>
        Crop No Loss</h2>
    <p>
        Crop No-Loss allows JPEG images to be cropped without any quality loss. Normally every
        time you re-save a <a href="formats.html">JPEG</a> Image quality is lost due to
        the nature of the JPEG format.</p>
    <p>
        Crop No-Loss does not always crop on the exact boundary selected due to limitations
        in the way JPEG images are stored. Typically the crop will be rounded off to the
        closest 8 pixel boundary.
