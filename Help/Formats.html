                    JPEG (pronounced 'jay-peg') is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG
                    stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee
                    that wrote the standard. JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale
                    images of natural, real-world scenes. It works well on photographs, naturalistic
                    artwork, and similar material; not so well on lettering, simple cartoons, or line
                    drawings. JPEG handles only still images, but there is a related standard called
                    MPEG for motion pictures. JPEG is 'lossy,' meaning that the decompressed image isn't
                    quite the same as the one you started with. (There are lossless image compression
                    algorithms, but JPEG achieves much greater compression than is possible with lossless
                    methods.)

                    The Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format was designed to replace the older and
                    simpler GIF format and, to some extent, the much more complex TIFF format. For the
                    Web, PNG really has three main advantages over GIF: alpha channels (variable transparency),
                    gamma correction (cross-platform control of image brightness), and two-dimensional
                    interlacing (a method of progressive display). PNG also compresses better than GIF
                    in almost every case, but the difference is generally only around 5% to 25%, not
                    a large enough factor to encourage folks to switch on that basis alone. One GIF
                    feature that PNG does not try to reproduce is multiple-image support, especially
                    animations; PNG was and is intended to be a single-image format only.

                    TIFF's are one of the most widely supported file formats for storing bit-mapped
                    images on personal computers (both PCs and Macintosh computers). TIFF graphics can
                    be any resolution, and they can be black and white, gray-scaled, or color. A primary
                    goal of TIFF is to provide a rich environment within which applications can exchange
                    image data. This richness is required to take advantage of the varying capabilities
                    of scanners and other imaging devices. Though TIFF is a rich format, it can easily
                    be used for simple scanners and applications as well because the number of required
                    fields is small.</td>
