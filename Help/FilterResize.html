		<P>Resize allows an image to be made larger or smaller by changing the number of 
			pixels it contains. An image with less pixels fill take up less space when 
			saved but will not be as detailed.</P>
		<P>ImageWalker allows three main ways or types of resizing an image.</P>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<STRONG>Pixel based</STRONG>
			dimensions are entered as a number of pixels directly.
			<li>
				<STRONG>Inch based</STRONG>
			dimensions are entered in inches and a new pixel size is generated based on 
			image resolution (pixels per inch)
			<li>
				<STRONG>Centimetres based</STRONG> dimensions are entered in centimetres and a 
				new pixel size is generated based on image resolution (pixels per centimetres)</li>
		</ol>
		<P>It is also possible to set a <b>filter </b>that will be used to resize the 
			image. This filter defines how the pixels in the image will be sampled during 
			the resize. Selecting <b>Optimised</b> will normally give the best 
			results. Experimenting with different filters is also recommended because 
			different images may respond better to a specific filter.</P>
