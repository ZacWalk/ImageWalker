        Image File Formats</h1>
    <p>
        Images can be saved in many formats. Each format has certain advantages and disadvantages.</p>
    <h4>
        <a name="JPEG">What is a JPEG?</a></h4>
    <p>
        JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)</p>
    <p>
        JPEG image compression method works well on photographs, naturalistic artwork, and
        similar material; not so well on lettering, simple cartoons, or black-and-white
        line drawings (files come out very large).</p>
    <p>
        JPEG is &quot;lossy&quot;, meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't
        quite identical to what you originally put in. The algorithm achieves much of its
        compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that
        small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.
        Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.</p>
    <p>
        A lot of people are scared off by the term &quot;lossy compression&quot;. But when
        it comes to representing real-world scenes, no digital image format can retain all
        the information that impinges on your eyeball. By comparison with the real-world
        scene, JPEG loses far less information than GIF.</p>
    <p>
        ImageWalker supports several loss-less filters that can rotate or crop JPEG images
        without causing any further loss when the JPEG image is re-saved. You should try
        to use these filters when working with JPEG images.</p>
    <p>
        Quality v Compression</p>
    <p>
        A useful property of JPEG is that adjusting compression parameters can vary the
        degree of lossiness. This means that the image creator can trade off file size against
        output image quality.</p>
    <p>
        For good-quality, full-color source images, the default quality setting (Q 75) is
        very often the best choice. Try Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.</p>

    <h4>
        <a name="GIF">What is a GIF?</a></h4>
    <p>
        GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)</p>
    <p>
        <br>
        The Graphics Interchange Format was developed in 1987 at the request of CompuServe,
        who needed a platform independent image format that was suitable for transfer across
        slow connections. It is a compressed (loss less) format (it uses the LZW compression)
        and compresses at a ratio of between 3:1 and 5:2.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is an 8-bit format, which means the maximum number of colors supported by the
        format is 257.</p>
    <p>
        There are two GIF standards, 87a and 89a (developed in 1987 and 1989 respectively).
        The 89a standard has additional features such as improved interlacing, the ability
        to define one color to be transparent and the ability to store multiple images in
        one file to create a basic form of animation.</p>
    <p>
        ImageWalker can combine multiple images to a single animated gif?</p>

    <h4>
        <a name="PNG">What is a PNG?</a></h4>
    <p>
        PNG (Portable Network Graphics format)</p>
    <p>
        In January 1995 Unisys, the company CompuServe contracted to create the 
            GIF format, announced that they would be enforcing the patent on the LZW
        compression technique the GIF format uses. This means that commercial developers
        that include the GIF encoding or decoding algorithms have to pay a license fee to
        CompuServe.</p>
    <p>
        However, a number of people banded together and created a completely patent-free
        graphics format called PNG (pronounced &quot;ping&quot;), the Portable Network Graphics
        format. PNG is superior to GIF in that it has better compression and supports millions
        of colors. PNG files end in a .png suffix.</p>

    <h4>
        <a name="USE">When should I use JPEG, over GIF or PNG?</a></h4>
    <p>
        JPEG is not going to displace GIF or PNG entirely.
        For some types of images, GIF or PNG is superior in image quality, file size, or
        both. One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kind of images to apply
        it to.</p>
    <p>
        Generally speaking, JPEG is superior to GIF or PNG for storing full-color or gray-resize
        images of &quot;realistic&quot; scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar
        material. Any continuous variation in color, such as occurs in highlighted or shaded
        areas, will be represented more faithfully and in less space by JPEG than by GIF
        or PNG.</p>
    <p>
        GIF OR PNG does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,
        such as line drawings and simple cartoons. Not only is GIF OR PNG loss less for
        such images, but also it often compresses them more than JPEG can. For example,
        GIF OR PNG compresses large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color
        very efficiently indeed. JPEG can't squeeze such data as much as GIF OR PNG does
        without introducing visible defects. (One implication of this is that large single-color
        borders are quite cheap in GIF or PNG files, while they are best avoided in JPEG
        files.)</p>
    <p>
        JPEG has problems with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to
        a row of pure-white pixels, for example. Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless
        you use a very high quality setting. Edges this sharp are rare in scanned photographs,
        but are fairly common in GIF OR PNG files: borders, overlaid text, etc. The blurriness
        is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have
        a GIF or PNG with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.</p>
    <p>
        Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG; they
        violate all of the conditions given above. You need at least about 16 gray levels
        before JPEG is useful for gray-resize images. It should also be noted that GIF or
        PNG is loss less for gray-resize images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.</p>
