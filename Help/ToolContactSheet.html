		<P>The contact sheet creation wizard creates contact sheets to display the images 
			in the current folder. The contact sheet takes settings&nbsp;from the print 
			view and can be accessed only from the print mode.</P>
		<P>
			The wizard takes you through several steps and will prompt you for the 
			following settings. For more information see <a href="ToolContactSheet.htm">How to 
				create contact sheets</a>.</P>
		<P>The wizard has the following sections:</P>
		<p><b>Input: </b>Allows you to select files to be processed, either all or selected 
			images. Images in sub folders can also be processed.</p>
		<p><b>Contact Sheet Settings:</b> Define the overall contact sheet size and other 
			view options.&nbsp;You can enter or select the proposed contact sheet size. 
			Thumbnail size is automatically calculated based on the contact sheet 
			dimensions.</p>
