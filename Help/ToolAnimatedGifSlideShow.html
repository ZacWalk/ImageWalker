selected images. Images in sub folders can also be processed.</p>

<p><b>Scale Size:</b> Defines how large the animated gif image will be.</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Defines the</span> file name for the Animated Gif 
Slide Show and time delay between each image.</p>

<P><b>Tip:</b> The larger the image the larger the final GIF file size. If you plan
to place this image on a web page it is best to limit the size of you image.</P>
