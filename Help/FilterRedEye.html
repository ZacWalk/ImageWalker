<P>Red eye reduction reduces the red component of the selected part of an image.</P>

<P>Typically best results can be achieved by zooming in on an image, selecting 
the red-eye section of an image before applying this filter. </P>

<P><b>Note: </b>ImageWalker employs a red eye reduction algorithm designed to 
work on the greatest cross section of images, if it does not work for a specific 
image it is recommended you use a more advanced application such as Adobe 
Photoshop.</P>
