ImageWalker
===========

This is a slightly cut down version of ImageWalker 2.31. Older libraries that did not build with Visual Studio were removed. The main difference is that some unusual image types are not supported.

ImageWalker has been superseded by Diffractor. I don't plan any new releases of ImageWalker.
